        <div class="title">Top left bell icon-Start with the bell!</div>
        <span class="subtitle">You can adjust a lot of settings there to create a space that is most apt for productivity. You can also ‘pause’ your notifications for a customizable timeframe to maintain a distraction free environment.</span>

        <div class="title">The ‘+’ next to Direct Messages-Press it!</div>
        <span class="subtitle">This will enable you to create a custom direct message with anyone in the group. Working on a team project? Set up a chat for just you to brainstorm and plan. Too shy to post a question in the main board? Direct message to get those answers. </span>

        <div class="title">Search Bar-Find it quick!</div>
        <span class="subtitle">Looking for a Zoom meeting and can’t remember where you saw it? No need to get flustered scrolling through posts. Top right search bar to the rescue. </span>

        <div class="title">Reminders- Don’t forget it!</div>
        <span class="subtitle">See something you want to look over again at a specific time? Hit those three dots on the right of the post and click, “Remind me about this” and choose a time. This is a great option when you’re right in the middle of something and need to come back to a post. </span>
